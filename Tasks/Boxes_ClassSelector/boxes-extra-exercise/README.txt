YOUR TASK:
Write some CSS to make xtra.html look like screenshot1.png that you have been provided with.

THE RULES:
1. You may not alter the HTML code in any way.
2. You may not alter the CSS that is already present in xtra.css
3. You can add new CSS rules to xtra.css
4. You should try to use "em" values for any margin or padding properties you set

HINTS:
- This exercise is all about the box model properties... border/margin/padding/background
- The h1 background colour value is #999999
- The font-size for all elements does not need to be altered

EXTRA CHALLENGE:
Can you figure out how to eliminate the small amount of white-space between the text and the edge of the browser window?
See screenshot2.png for what you are aiming for.
