        <h1>Common Pets</h1>
        <p>There are many different animals kept as pets. The most popular pets are noted for their attractive appearances and their loyal or playful personalities.</p>
        <h2>Dogs</h2>
        <p>The domestic dog is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviours, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores. Unlike obligate carnivores, dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.</p>
        <h2>Cats</h2>
        <p>The domestic cat or the feral cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Cats are obligate carnivores: their physiology has evolved to efficiently process meat, and they have difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Domestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis, typically weighing between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 10 lb). Some breeds, however, such as the Maine Coon, can occasionally exceed 11 kg (24 lb).</p>
